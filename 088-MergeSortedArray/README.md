# 88. Merge Sorted Array

**Difficulty:** Easy

## Problem

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

Merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned but instead be stored inside `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
```

## Constraints

- `nums1.length == m + n`
- `nums2.length == n`
- `0 <= m, n <= 200`
- `1 <= m + n <= 200`
- `-10^9 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10^9`

## Solution Approach

Use three pointers and fill from the end of nums1 to avoid overwriting elements.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(m + n) - Single pass
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - In-place merge
