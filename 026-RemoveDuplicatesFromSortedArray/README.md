# 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

**Difficulty:** Easy

## Problem

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Return the number of unique elements `k`. The first `k` elements of `nums` should contain the unique numbers in sorted order.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
- `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order

## Solution Approach

Use two pointers: one for iterating and one for tracking the position of unique elements.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - Single pass through array
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - In-place modification
